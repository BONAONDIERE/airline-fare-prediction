# 📊 Project Overview

* Problem: Airline ticket prices are highly volatile, making it difficult for travelers and businesses to budget effectively.

* Solution: A machine learning model that predicts prices based on features like route, time until departure, seasonality, and market trends.

* Impact: The model can be used to recommend the optimal time to purchase tickets, potentially saving significant costs.

# 🛠️ Technical Details

* Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

* Techniques:Time-Series Analysis, Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)

* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

* Evaluation Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

# 📁 Dataset Note

Due to the large size of the dataset required for this project, it is stored on Google Drive and is loaded directly within the Google Colab notebook. The notebook contains all the necessary code to access and preprocess the data.
